Project Description

This project is about Predicting Flight Prices using Regression techniques to find Mean Absolute Error, Mean squared Error, Root mean Squared Error and r2 score. I have used Extra tree regressor for Feature Selection and Random Forest regressor to fit the model and do predictions. Data source is Kaggle Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh. 
In this project, Data Preprocessing and data cleaning is a major challenge. The visualization plots helped in checking assumptions for Regression Technique.

Needs of this project

data exploration/descriptive statistics
data processing/cleaning
statistical modeling
writeup/reporting
etc.
